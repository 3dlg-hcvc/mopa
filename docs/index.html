                            Our work focuses on the Multi-Object Navigation (MultiON) task, where an agent needs to
                            navigate to
                            multiple objects in a given sequence. We systematically investigate the inherent modularity
                            of this
                            task by dividing our approach to contain four modules: (a) an object detection module
                            trained to
                            identify objects from RGB images, (b) a map building module to build a semantic map of the
                            observed
                            objects, (c) an exploration module enabling the agent to explore its surroundings, and
                            finally (d) a
                            navigation module to move to identified target objects. We focus on the navigation and the
                            exploration modules in this work. We show that we can effectively leverage a PointGoal
                            navigation
                            model in the MultiON task instead of learning to navigate from scratch. Our experiments show
                            that a
                            PointGoal agent-based navigation module outperforms analytical path planning on the MultiON
                            task. We
                            also compare exploration strategies and surprisingly find that a random exploration strategy
                            significantly outperforms more advanced exploration methods. We additionally create MultiON
                            2.0, a
                            new large-scale dataset as a test-bed for our approach.

                    <h2>Approach: Modular-MON</h2>
                    &nbsp;
                    <img class="intro-image" src="images/architecture.png" />
                    In the MultiON task, the agent is given the current goal
                    gi from a set of N goals {g1, g2, ..., gN }. Once the agent has
                    reached gi and generated the Found action successfully, it is
                    given the next goal gi+1. This continues until the agent has
                    found all the goals in the episode. In Modular-MON,
                    we take a modular approach to multi-object navigation by
                    employing the following modules: (1) Object detection (O),
                    (2) Map building (M), (3) Exploration (E) and (4) Navigation (N ). These modules are intuitively
                    weaved
                    together.
                    Modular-MON identifies objects (O) by observing the environment and builds a semantic map (M) by
                    projecting
                    information about category labels of the objects (i.e. semantics) in the field of view. If the agent
                    has
                    not
                    yet discovered
                    the current goal, gi, it will continue to explore (E). Once
                    the current goal has been discovered, Modular-MON plans a
                    path from its current location to the goal, and generates actions to navigate (N) towards the goal.
                    We
                    experiment with
                    different exploration and navigation strategies to systematically investigate their contribution to
                    the
                    agent performance.

                        <img class="intro-image" src="images/results-table2.png" />
                        We observe that the PredictedSem agent, which builds a map (M) using predicted
                        semantic labels (O), performs better on cylinder (‘CYL’) objects than natural (‘NAT’) objects.
                        We
                        compare its performance with two oracle agents, OracleMap and OracleSem where ground-truth
                        (‘GT’) is
                        provided for either the
                        mapping or object
                        semantics. As expected, the performance are mostly identical for the two object types for
                        OracleMap
                        and
                        OracleSem, since
                        the placement of the objects are the same for both, with OracleMap outperforming OracleSem.
                        These
                        methods use Uniform
                        Top-down Sampling w/ Fail-Safe (‘Uf’) as the Exploration (E) module and PointNav [52 ] (‘PN’) as
                        the
                        Navigation (N )
                        module.

                        We also investigate how our Modular-MON performs on the
                        Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task in the above table. We observe that the performance
                        deteriorates
                        as we increase target objects, for
                        a fixed step limit (rows 1-3). Our OracleSem performs similarly on the <a
                            href="https://aihabitat.org/challenge/2022/">Habitat ObjectNav 2022</a> and MultiON 2.0 1ON
                        val
                        set (rows 5,6) when we set the step limit to 500 steps, following ObjectNav task setting. In
                        ObjectNav,
                        OracleSem
                        performs better (rows 6,7) with Uniform Top-down Sampling w/ Fail-Safe (Uf) than Frontier (F).
                        Moreover,
                        our PredictedSem performs
                        better on MultiON2.0 than on ObjectNav (rows 8,9).

                            In the MultiON task, Modular-MON fails due to the agent
                            running out of step limit, or stopping at a location far away
                            from the goal. For those cases where the agent ran out
                            of steps, it either has not yet discovered the goal or has
                            discovered the goal but failed to stop within 1m of it.
                            On the other hand, Modular-MON fails on the ObjectNav task since some episodes
                            fail even when the agent is within 1m of the goal bounding
                            box with the goal in sight.
